## Complete Example: Lighting Design for Macbeth

Here's a comprehensive example showing how a lighting designer would use LacyLights MCP to create a complete lighting design for Shakespeare's Macbeth:

### Step 1: Create the Project

```
Use create_project to create a new project called "Macbeth - Main Stage 2024"
with description "Shakespeare's Macbeth, directed by Jane Smith, March 2024 production"
```

### Step 2: Set Up Fixtures

```
Use create_fixture_instance to add these fixtures to the project:
- 12x Chauvet SlimPAR Pro RGBA fixtures for front wash (channels 1-48)
- 8x Martin MAC Quantum Profile moving heads for specials (channels 100-163)
- 6x ETC Source Four LED Series 2 for side lighting (channels 200-241)
- 4x Chauvet Strike 4 strobes for storm effects (channels 300-315)
- 2x Rosco Vapour Plus hazers for atmosphere (channels 400-403)
```

### Step 3: Analyze the Script

```
Use analyze_script with the full text of Act 1 to extract:
- All lighting cues mentioned in stage directions
- Scene transitions that need lighting changes
- Mood and atmosphere requirements for each scene
```

### Step 4: Generate Key Scenes

```
Use generate_scene to create these essential scenes:

1. "Opening - Thunder and Lightning"
   - Script context: "Thunder and lightning. Enter three witches."
   - Mood: ominous, supernatural
   - Color palette: ["deep purple", "electric blue", "white strobe"]
   - Intensity: dramatic

2. "Duncan's Arrival at Inverness"
   - Script context: "Hautboys and torches. Enter Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Banquo"
   - Mood: regal, warm
   - Color palette: ["warm amber", "gold", "soft orange"]
   - Intensity: moderate

3. "Lady Macbeth Reads the Letter"
   - Script context: "Enter Lady Macbeth, reading a letter"
   - Mood: intimate, plotting
   - Color palette: ["cool blue", "pale amber", "shadow"]
   - Focus areas: ["center stage", "downstage center"]

4. "The Dagger Soliloquy"
   - Script context: "Is this a dagger which I see before me"
   - Mood: hallucinatory, tense
   - Color palette: ["blood red", "deep shadow", "cold steel blue"]
   - Intensity: subtle
   - Focus areas: ["center stage spot"]

5. "Murder of Duncan"
   - Script context: "Macbeth exits to kill Duncan, bell rings"
   - Mood: dark, suspenseful
   - Color palette: ["deep red", "black", "moonlight blue"]
   - Intensity: dramatic

6. "Banquo's Ghost Appears"
   - Script context: "The Ghost of Banquo enters, and sits in Macbeth's place"
   - Mood: supernatural, terrifying
   - Color palette: ["ghostly green", "cold white", "shadow"]
   - Effects: use moving heads for ghost tracking

7. "Lady Macbeth's Sleepwalking"
   - Script context: "Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper"
   - Mood: haunted, guilty
   - Color palette: ["candlelight amber", "moonlight", "deep shadow"]
   - Focus areas: ["follow spot", "single candle effect"]

8. "Final Battle"
   - Script context: "Alarums. Enter Macbeth and Macduff fighting"
   - Mood: violent, chaotic
   - Color palette: ["fire red", "steel blue", "explosive white"]
   - Intensity: dramatic
   - Effects: strobe for sword clashes
```

### Step 5: Create Cue Sequences

```
Use create_cue_sequence to build the Act 1 cue list:
- Name: "Act 1 - Complete"
- Include all Act 1 scenes in order
- Set default fade times: 3 seconds in, 3 seconds out
- Add follow cues for quick transitions during soliloquies
```

### Step 6: Generate Act Cues with Script Analysis

```
Use generate_act_cues with the complete text of Act 2:
- This will analyze the script and create a complete cue list
- Automatically times transitions based on dramatic pacing
- Suggests lighting changes for every entrance, exit, and mood shift
```

### Step 7: Optimize for Performance

```
Use optimize_cue_timing on the Act 1 cue list:
- Strategy: "dramatic_timing"
- This will adjust fade times for maximum dramatic impact
- Smooth transitions for scene changes
- Sharp cuts for supernatural appearances
```

### Step 8: Create Special Effect Sequences

```
Use create_cue_sequence for the storm effect:
1. Lightning Strike 1 (strobes at full, 0.1s)
2. Thunder Roll (deep blue wash, 2s fade)
3. Lightning Strike 2 (strobes at 75%, 0.15s)
4. Return to storm base (purple/blue, 3s fade)
- Set follow times for automatic progression
```

### Step 9: Run the Show

During performance, the stage manager can use:

```
start_cue_list "Act 1 - Complete"
next_cue  # Advance through each cue
go_to_cue 15.5  # Jump to specific cue for pickups
fade_to_black 5  # Emergency blackout with 5-second fade
```

### Step 10: Make Live Adjustments

```
Use update_scene to adjust the "Banquo's Ghost" scene:
- Increase moving head intensity for better visibility
- Adjust color temperature based on costume reflectance
- Fine-tune positioning for actor's blocking changes
```

## Advanced Usage Examples

### Script-Driven Design Workflow

```
1. Analyze the entire script:
   analyze_script with full play text

2. Review extracted cues and scenes

3. Generate all suggested scenes in batch:
   generate_scene for each suggestion

4. Create master cue list:
   create_cue_sequence with all scenes

5. Optimize for your venue:
   optimize_scene for each scene with "technical_simplicity"
```

### Multi-Universe Setup

```
For large productions spanning multiple DMX universes:

1. Plan channel allocation:
   suggest_channel_assignment for all fixtures

2. Create fixtures with specific universe assignments:
   create_fixture_instance with universe: 1 for front lights
   create_fixture_instance with universe: 2 for moving heads
   create_fixture_instance with universe: 3 for effects

3. View the complete channel map:
   get_channel_map for the project
```

### Collaborative Design Process

```
Director requests:
"I want the witches' scenes to feel otherworldly but not cartoonish"

Use generate_scene:
- Description: "Witches on the heath"
- Mood: "otherworldly, mysterious"
- Color palette: ["deep violet", "fog grey", "pale green"]
- Intensity: "subtle"

Then iterate with optimize_scene using "dramatic_impact" until satisfied
```

3. **OpenAI API errors**
   - Ensure your `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in the `.env` file
   - Verify the API key has access to GPT-4

4. **MCP connection errors in Claude**
   - Use the full absolute path in your Claude configuration
   - Restart Claude after updating the MCP configuration
   - Check Claude's logs for detailed error messages

5. **"Unexpected token ?" error**
   - Update your config to use the full path to Node.js 14+
   - On macOS with Homebrew: `"command": "/opt/homebrew/bin/node"`
   - On other systems, find your node path with: `which node`

## ChromaDB Setup (Optional - For Enhanced RAG)

The MCP server works out of the box with in-memory pattern storage. For persistent vector storage and more sophisticated pattern matching:

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Start ChromaDB with Docker
docker-compose up -d chromadb

# Verify it's running
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v2/heartbeat
```

### Option 2: Local Installation
```bash
# Install ChromaDB
pip install chromadb

# Start the server
chroma run --host localhost --port 8000
```

Then update your `.env` file:
```bash
# Uncomment these lines in .env
CHROMA_HOST=localhost
CHROMA_PORT=8000
```
